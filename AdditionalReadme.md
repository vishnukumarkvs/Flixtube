EXPOSE vs -p

- If you specify neither EXPOSE nor -p, the service in the container will only be accessible from inside the container itself.

- If you EXPOSE a port, the service in the container is not accessible from outside Docker, but from inside other Docker containers. So this is good for inter-container communication.

- If you EXPOSE and -p a port, the service in the container is accessible from anywhere, even outside Docker.

- If you do -p, but do not EXPOSE, Docker does an implicit EXPOSE. This is because if a port is open to the public, it is automatically also open to other Docker containers. Hence -p includes EXPOSE. This is effectively same as 3).


# Management version rabbitmq gives dashboard

History and video-streaming microservice depends on rabbitmq.rabbitmq is heavy microservice and takes time. so, rabbitmq needs to wait. we use wait-port for that (needs to check depends on)
Also, all microservices needs to handle disconnection and connecting again with rabbitmq


rabbitmq needs wait-port. Mongodb automatically handles reconnections


messageChannel.publish("viewed","", Buffer.from(jsonMsg)) check this in stage6 - exchange name, key, payload

Sometimes direct messaging is useful, but generally speaking, indirect messaging allows for much more complex and resilient networks of behaviors. We might struggle to understand how it all fits together in its complexity, but at least we know that itâ€™s reliable!

Steps
video-streaming
- asserts exchange - fanout type, name=viewed
- returns channel from exchange
- publish message to channel

history and recommendations
- asserts exchange
- creates a queue
- bind it with exchange
- consume the payload
