- This repo is built based on the book  [Bootstrapping Microservices with Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/bootstrapping-microservices-with/9781617297212/) by Ashley Davis
- This repo is a microservices project. 
- It has many branches starting from stage1.
- As we move on from stages, we build microservices from scratch to containerizing the application to deploying it in Azure using Terraform

### Here are all the stages from stage1
- Simple nodejs video-streaming microservice
- Microservice which streams a video file from Azure blob storage
- Creating two microservices and connecting them
- Creating 3rd microservice which is a database(mongodb) that stores metadata of video
- Creating a history microservice
- Using rabbitmq for decoupling microservices
- Exploring RabbitMQ exchange
- Connecting frontend to backend
